/*
Declare a variable called pizza and assign it a string value of a pizza type of your choosing e.g., "cheese" - ( (although it should probably be pepperoni ;)).

Next, declare a function called checkNumber that takes a number as an argument and returns the string "positive" if the argument is greater than 0 and "negative" if the argument is less than 0. What if the argument is 0? Add an else condition that returns "zero".

Then, test the function to be sure that it works. Open the html file and use the DevTools in the browser to display the output in the console.

Did you use const or let to declare the pizza variable? What is the difference between the two keywords?

Lastly, explain the scope of your function parameter and the pizza variable.

let pizza = "Pineapple"

function checkNumber(number){
    if (number > 0){
        return "positive"
    }
    else if (number < 0){
        return "negative"
    }
    else (number = 0) 
        return "zero"
}

let pizza = "mushroom"
